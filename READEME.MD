The Projact is Malshinin 
Today I'm trying to rebuild the system and look at it from a new perspective after yesterday's general rant. Right now I'm starting with searching for a person and adding a person. 
UPDATE -10-06-25- 17:18PM I created a file where the database path is entered and the references are made intelligently (with one change for all), in addition I created an instance for the person line that we are editing - which allows easy access from anywhere with a one-time import from the database. In addition, we edited and completed the required person identification class.
